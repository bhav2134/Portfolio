        Hey there! I'm a computer science amateur at 
        <span className='uni'> Toronto Metropolitan University</span>, 
        on a wild quest to become the ultimate full-stack maestro and spend my days behind a computer screen.
        When I'm not tangled up in code, you'll find me lifting weights,
        strumming my guitar, struggling to breath during hikes, or diving headfirst into a good book.

        My coding passion lies in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Frontend Engineering, and Data Engineering. 
        I've got big dreams, and one of them involves unleashing a monstrous open-source project into the world. 
        Think of it as my love letter to the tech universe, 
        complete with lots of code that would need to be polished.
        <p></p>

        I believe in the magic of collaboration and think open source is where it's at. 
        So, get ready for a rollercoaster ride of innovation and creativity‚ÄîI'm cooking up something special 
        for the entire developer community! More exciting things coming your way soon!
