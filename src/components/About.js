        Hey there! I'm a computer science amateur at 
        <span className='uni'> Toronto Metropolitan University</span>, 
        on a wild quest to become the ultimate full-stack maestro. When I'm not tangled up in code, you'll find me pumping iron,
        strumming my guitar, hiking like a champ, or diving headfirst into a good book.

        My coding heart dances to the beat of LLM software, quantitative finance, and video game development. 
        I've got big dreams, and one of them involves unleashing a monstrous open-source project into the world. 
        Think of it as my love letter to the tech universe, 
        complete with all the bells, whistles, and lines of code you never knew you needed.
        <p></p>

        I believe in the magic of collaboration and think open source is where it's at. 
        So, get ready for a rollercoaster ride of innovation and creativityâ€”I'm cooking up something special 
        for the entire developer community! More exciting things coming your way soon!
