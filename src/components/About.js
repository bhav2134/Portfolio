        Hey there! I'm a computer science amateur at 
        <span className='uni'> Toronto Metropolitan University</span>, 
        on a wild quest to become the ultimate full-stack maestro and spend my days behind a computer screen.
        When I'm not tangled up in code, you'll find me struggling to lift iron,
        strumming my guitar, hiking like a sloth, or diving headfirst into a good book.

        My coding heart dances to the beat of LLM software, quantitative finance, and video game development. 
        I've got big dreams, and one of them involves unleashing a monstrous open-source project into the world. 
        Think of it as my love letter to the tech universe, 
        complete with lots of code that would need to be polished.
        <p></p>

        I believe in the magic of collaboration and think open source is where it's at. 
        So, get ready for a rollercoaster ride of innovation and creativityâ€”I'm cooking up something special 
        for the entire developer community! More exciting things coming your way soon!
